Finished EVE Online route optimizer. Comprises two modules; Router and retRouter

Router is used to calculate optimal routes, and accepts a YAML-encoded map file as well as system IDs for startpoints and endpoints
Creating said maps is done via the mapMaker() function, accepting a map (should be baseMap.yaml) and a warp speed, subwarp speed, and align
The returned map can then be used for route calculations or stored for later use using write_yaml

retRouter is used for mass statistical analysis. Center() which calculates the lowest combined travel time from a system to all others
(to specify, the lowest of all the combined travel times from each system to all others). It directly accepts a map (should be "retMap") and a warp speed, subwarp speed, and align
It outputs a dict of all systems and their combined travel time to others, which can be stored or parsed.

Other files and programs were used for construction or interim coding stages, and are not intended for final use. They remain only for posterity.
